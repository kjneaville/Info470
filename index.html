<h1>Utilization of Social Media Platforms for Academic Communication</h1>
<h2>Kenneth Neaville
INFO 470 Assignment #4: Research Proposal</h2>
<p>Social media has long been associated with connecting users to create and sustain personal relationships. Photos can be shared, life events can be made public, and friendships can be strengthened. In the past few years, however, there has been a growing emphasis on the implementation of social media within a professional context. Websites like LinkedIn and Google+ focus more on business networking and employment than entertainment. Similarly, social media is increasing its usage within the sphere of education. Students use their existing profiles on popular websites to connect with classmates and collaborate on class assignments. Since course content (lectures, projects, home) is more frequently being stored online, it makes sense that students need a way to work and collaborate online as well.</p>
<p>In the past decade alone there has been an explosion of online education. Instead of going to class to watch a teacher write on a chalkboard, millions of students now log onto educational websites in order to view lecture content directly from wherever they want, whenever they want it. This amazing tool has been embraced globally, and with leaders such as MIT and Harvard posting free lecture series online, there is no limit to who can benefit from this new technology. In contrast, many criticize these new technologies since much of the human-to-human interaction is lost. Fortunately, new collaboration tools have come into existence so that students can ask questions, comment on lectures, and discuss course content. Rather than watching lectures in a passive way the same way one would watch a television show, students can now become engaged in digital education and interact with it the same way they would as if they were in person. Surprisingly, many students prefer to use popular social media platforms instead of those designed specifically for scholarly communication.</p>
<p>With a growing emphasis on education automation, finding a way to replace in-class interaction with digital interaction is critical to not only the acceptance of online classes, but also to student retention of knowledge. Whether these interaction tools are integrated into existing educational platforms, supplied by third-party providers, or chosen to be leading social media websites, there still remains the question to identify exactly what students need. And because many students choose to use their online personal profiles instead of those designed solely for academic purposes, the question remains as to what large social media websites offer that smaller academic platforms do not. Regardless, it is important to examine the current status of online learning and communication tools.</p>
<p>Current research suggests that online lectures are less effective than lectures viewed in person. Although the benefits of online lectures are abundant—no travel time, nonexistent scheduling conflicts, lower costs for instructors—there are also some major drawbacks—lack of feedback from students, reduced comprehension of quantitative curriculum, and uncertainty about course logistics (Hannay & Newvine, 2005). On the other hand, studies have proved that online lectures have at least some value. When used as a supplement to traditional lectures, online lectures can significantly boost student test scores (Gonzalez 2014, McVey 2009). Additionally, online teaching and learning activities can accommodate student diversity in ways a single instructor cannot. The various socio-economic backgrounds, English language abilities, learning styles, and prior knowledge can all be taken account in order to deliver dynamic, individualized education. Snowball found that students appreciated online learning activities and were more likely to spend time studying. He also found that student performance increased with interactive online activities rather than passive online activities (Snowball 2014). These findings illustrate that online interaction technologies can improve student learning.</p>
<p>But a question still remains as to our current level of implementation of this technology. Online education is defined as a form of distance education that uses computers and the Internet as the delivery mechanism, with at least 80% of the course content delivered online (Le et al., 2010).  As of 2012, 6.7 million students were currently enrolled in higher education online courses. This figure is expected to grow, as 69% of chief academic leaders indicated online learning was critical to their long-term success (Kentnor 2015). Online learning environments can provide other tools that chalkboards cannot, such as computer simulations of wires for electrical engineering courses (Liu & Siu 2011). With such an emphasis on this type of learning, it is critical we now discover how we can boost the effectiveness of online resources through the inclusion of interaction tools.</p>
<p>It is also important to define what exactly we mean when we look at “interaction tools.” With new applications being pioneered faster than we can conduct studies on them, it can be difficult to analyze them empirically. There exists a wide range of tools for online interaction—from third-party applications such as MeetingWords (that we use for this class) to embedded comments and discussions within lectures that allow users to link to a certain part within the video. Research shows students who take online classes and actively participate in online discussion with instructor input outperform their traditional classroom counterparts (McVey 2009). In fact, students report the most negative aspect of online courses is the lack of interaction with the instructor and fellow students, a course component that boosts student learning and satisfaction (Vannatta & Bannister 2009).</p>
<p>The two parts of an online classroom are the instructional communicating environment and collaborative learning environment. The latter contains the discussions for learners and other interactive tools (Yang & Liu 2007). A collaborative learning environment can “democratize” a classroom, giving students the same opportunities for participation and expression, regardless of their personal characteristics (Alcaraz-Salarirche et al., 2011). This makes sense because responding to a question online is more flexible, easier to begin/finish contact, and less personal than responding to a question face to face.</p> 
<p>Some courses have even gone as far as using social media as a teaching and learning tool. Educational platforms vary in their degree of user connection, collaboration, and creation of content. Existing social media technologies (i.e. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube) already have the framework to create communities and exchange information, so why not use them for educational purposes? Troubles with using social media to promote interaction, however, are the intersection of personal and professional online identities, distraction, and intellectual property laws (Davis, Ho, Last 2015). Although there currently exists little data on whether social media aids in learning, this may be an ingenious way to incorporate interaction since almost all students already use these platforms for information exchange outside of class.</p>
<p>Social media allows users to share anything they want anytime they want. Summarize (Kumi-Yeboah & Blankson, 2014). This recent study even recommended that future studies examine the practices of students who use social media.</p>
<p>As a result, it is important to create research methods in order to examine the both the presence of and motivation behind social media within an academic context. Although research has been heavily conducted on the effectiveness of online learning itself, fewer studies have focused on the tools associated with it that connect students. Of these, only a handful of studies include a focus on social media. To discover the existence of social media within academics I would design a survey where students report what social media websites they use and with what frequency. To target the advantages and disadvantages of such technologies for academic work, I would conduct interviews with university students.</p>
<p>In administering surveys, I would concentrate in acquiring a large pool of quantitative data that describes the population instead of focusing on how students feel about these technologies. This “population” would be all college students, as high school students and younger usually have restrictions on the usage of social media and can’t even access these networks from school computers. To incorporate random sampling, I would need to sample all majors, years, and student personalities. To do this I could hand out the survey on different buildings (most likely in the entrance that all students would need to enter through) across campus at different times of the day. The survey itself would include questions such as “What major are you?”, “What social media websites do you use?”, “What percentage of these websites have you used to communicate for your classes”, and “Is this your primary method of communication with other students in the class?”. When I have a large enough pool of data, I could graph the most popular platforms for classroom collaboration. A threat to validity would be inaccurate measures of how much the website was actually utilized (if the student simply checks a class Facebook page every day or has extensive conversations with group members, these would be difficult to differentiate). Another threat might be the scope of the population since a single university would not be representative of all higher education.</p>
<p>Interviews would focus more on quality of assessment instead of quantity of answers. I would identify full time students and offer them a cash incentive to complete the interview, making sure to include all majors, years, and personalities. These interview would be semi-structured, providing questions that will be asked to every interviewee (“Why do you use social media?”, “Do you have problems letting classmates see your personal profile?”, “Why don’t you use platforms specifically designed for the class?”) but with the ability to go into further depth. To analyze this data, I would create transcripts of participant responses and measure frequency of terms and other structural markers that indicate the importance of ideas. A threat to validity would involve the subjective nature of interviews—even with data analysis the views and biases of the interviewer or analyst may camouflage themselves within the results. Another threat may be in the fact of user recall—without the interfaces in front of them, users may not accurately remember why they chose to make the decisions they did.</p>
<p>Academic interaction online could dramatically boost the efficiency of digital learning, as it is able to accommodate any student to give and receive feedback from the class. If Facebook, for example, realized that a certain percentage of users were using their messaging system for group assignments, they could add options that would better accommodate this population or even create a separate messaging system.</p> 
<p>The usage of existing social media instead of the more anonymous academic-only websites could also reveal something about the students themselves. If students reveal that they actually like being able to glimpse into the personal lives of their classmates, it would suggest that students want to see a fuller picture of who their classmates are instead of strictly who they are in the classroom. Some students, on the other hand, may be totally opposed to their classmates having a way to see their personal lives, as many try to keep these identities separate. By addressing these ideas in the interview, researchers could sample the percentage of certain viewpoints.</p>
<p>If we discover that students in general prefer social media for the dissemination of classroom material, teachers and institutions may be inclined to use more of these platforms in the future (as in a teacher could use Twitter to announce assignments and class information). As the Web 2.0 emerges, there is a growing emphasis on interconnectivity and community. If students are able to connect with other students and maintain these connections beyond the initial assignment, it could prove valuable in many ways.</p>
